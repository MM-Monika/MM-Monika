Project Title: Website Traffic Analysis
Phase 1: Project Definition and Design Thinking
Project Definition:Website traffic analysis is the process of examining and understanding the traffic patterns and behavior of visitors on a website. It involves gathering and analyzing data to gain insights into the performance of a website, understand visitor preferences, and identify opportunities for improvement.This project encompasses defining the analysis objectives, collecting website traffic data, using IBM Cognos for data visualization, and integrating Python code for advanced analysis.
Design Thinking:
 Analysis Objectives: Define the key insights you want to extract from the website traffic data, such as identifying popular pages, traffic trends, and user engagement metrics.
 Data Collection: Determine the data sources and methods for collecting website traffic data, including page views, unique visitors, referral sources, and more.
 Visualization: Plan how to visualize the insights using IBM Cognos to create meaningful dashboards and reports.
 Python Integration: Consider incorporating machine learning models to predict future traffic trends or user behavior pattern
